# Numerical Linear Algebra Project - Sparse Iterative Solvers
This section covers 3 iterative solvers: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Conjugate Gradient Method. Three sample input matrices are also included (in .txt file).

How it works: Once the code is run, users will be asked to enter a matrix in .txt (or .csv) format. The code will analyze how many iterations required to converge and what the error is.

Keep in mind that the input matrix MUST BE a "Symmetric, Positive, and Definite" (SPD). Even more, Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iterative solvers require a strictly diagonally dominant matrix, or otherwise, the solver will never converge.

Thank you for your attention,
